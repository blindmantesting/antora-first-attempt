To produce a documentation site, Antora needs a playbook. Using your preferred text editor or IDE, create a new file and populate it with the configuration information listed below. Save this file as antora-playbook.yml in the docs-site directory you made in the previous step. This playbook file will create a site using the Antora demo repositories.
